      I was Born in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico in January 31 of the year 1995. 
      Some things I like to do is play soccer, videogames and watch every kind of movies,
      especially horror ones. <br>
      My favorite food is obviously tacos, whatever kind of taco is good for me.<br>
      I moved to Atlanta almost a year ago and I really enjoy the city, it's beautiful, 
      but I really miss my family, friends and food from Mexico, I also miss speaking
      spanish because I can get tired of speaking english all day.
